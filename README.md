# Zen Lambda Maven Repository


Welcome to the *Zen Lambda* Maven repository.

## Usage

To use this repository please add the following entry under the main `repositories` element in your pom:

	<repository>
	<id>zenlambda-releases</id>
	<url>http://mvn-repo.zenlambda.com/releases</url>
	</repository>
	
You will need a version of maven that supports HTTP redirect to use this repository. Maven 3.0.4 should work.

## I want one of these!

This was built following instructions I found on [Chas Emerick's blog](http://cemerick.com/2010/08/24/hosting-maven-repos-on-github/). Of course I did this some time ago and there may be better options now!
